# TypeSpec

A TypeScript BDD framework.

    npm install typespec-bdd

The aim is to properly separate the business specifications from the code, 
but rather than code-generate (like Java or C# BDD tools), the tests will be 
loaded and executed on the fly without converting the text into an 
intermediate language or framework. This should allow tests to be written using any 
unit testing framework - or even without one.
